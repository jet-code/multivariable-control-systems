Linear Multivariable Control Systems, ECE 6390

Computer Projects
CP1: System model reduction using the second Cauer method.

CP2: Implemented algorithm (used in Matlab's place.m function) 
in Python from the original journal paper. The algorithm is used
for pole placement in linear state feedback controllers.

CP3: Applied the matrix sign method to reduce a high order system.
LTI simulation, controller design, and Kalman filter design were 
coded in Matlab.
